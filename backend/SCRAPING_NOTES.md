# FedRAMP Marketplace Scraping Notes

## Issue
The FedRAMP marketplace website (`https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/products/`) appears to have protection against automated scraping. When attempting to access product pages programmatically (using both `requests` and Playwright browser automation), the pages return empty HTML content.

## Attempted Solutions
1. **Simple HTTP requests** - Returned 404 errors
2. **Playwright browser automation** - Pages load with 202 status but return empty HTML (`<html><head></head><body></body></html>`)
3. **Various wait strategies** - Waiting for network idle, DOM content, specific selectors - all unsuccessful

## Current Status
- Database is set up with 615 unique FedRAMP products from the CSV
- HTML scraping infrastructure is in place but cannot bypass the site's protections
- The scraper code is ready and would work if the site allowed programmatic access

## Alternative Approaches

### Option 1: Manual Collection
You can manually save HTML pages by:
1. Opening each product page in a browser
2. Right-click → "Save As" → "Webpage, Complete"
3. Save files as `{FEDRAMP_ID}.html` in `fedramp/data/html/`
4. Run a script to update the database with the paths

### Option 2: Browser Extension
Create a browser extension that:
- Visits each URL from the database
- Saves the fully-rendered HTML
- Updates the database automatically

### Option 3: API Access
Contact FedRAMP to see if they offer:
- An official API
- Bulk data export
- Permission for automated access

### Option 4: Use the CSV Data
The CSV already contains most useful information:
- Provider, offering name, descriptions
- Authorization status and dates
- Service models and assessors
- The frontend can display all this without the HTML

## Recommendation
For now, use Option 4 - the frontend will display all CSV data in a searchable, filterable table. The HTML scraping feature can be added later if access becomes available or if you manually collect some pages.
