# FedRAMP Marketplace Data Browser - Project Summary

## ✅ What Was Built

A complete web application for browsing and managing FedRAMP marketplace data with the following components:

### 1. Backend (Python)
- **Data Fetcher** (`backend/fetch_json.py`): Downloads latest data from official GSA JSON API
- **Database** (`backend/db.py`): SQLite database schema and query functions
- **CSV Loader** (`backend/load_csv.py`): Imports data from CSV files
- **Scraper** (`backend/scraper.py`): HTML scraping infrastructure (not needed - JSON is better!)

### 2. Data Storage
- **JSON File** (`data/fedramp_products.json`): Complete dataset with 615 products
- **SQLite Database** (`data/fedramp.db`): Structured database with all product information
- **Each product includes 40+ fields** with comprehensive details

### 3. Frontend (Next.js)
- **Product Listing Page**: View all 615 products with key information
- **Product Detail Pages**: Detailed view showing ALL services included in each authorization
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Quick overview of total products, providers, and services
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout the application

## 🎯 Key Features

### Discovery: Official JSON API
Instead of scraping HTML (which doesn't work due to site protection), we discovered the **official JSON API** maintained by GSA:

**URL**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GSA/marketplace-fedramp-gov-data/refs/heads/main/data.json`

This provides:
- ✅ All 615 FedRAMP products
- ✅ 40+ fields per product (vs ~16 in CSV)
- ✅ Complete list of authorized services per product
- ✅ Regular updates from GSA
- ✅ No rate limiting or access issues

### Example: AWS GovCloud
The detail page for AWS GovCloud (ID: F1603047866) shows:
- **145+ authorized services** including:
  - ✅ Amazon Bedrock (AI/ML)
  - ✅ Amazon SageMaker AI
  - ✅ AWS Lambda
  - ✅ Amazon S3
  - ✅ And 140+ more!

## 🚀 How to Use

### Start the Application

1. **Fetch Latest Data** (optional - already done):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python3 fetch_json.py
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. **Open Browser**:
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Browse Products
- **Home Page**: See all products in a table with filtering
- **Click "View Details"**: See complete information including ALL authorized services
- **Search**: Find products by provider, offering, or description

## 📊 Data Available

Each product includes:
- Basic Info: ID, provider, offering name
- Status: Authorization status, dates
- Technical: Service model (SaaS/PaaS/IaaS), deployment model, impact level
- Services: Complete list of authorized services (e.g., AWS has 145+ services)
- Contact: Sales email, security email, website
- Business: UEI number, small business status, business functions
- And much more...

## 💡 Key Insights

### Why HTML Scraping Failed
The FedRAMP marketplace website has protection against automated scraping:
- Returns empty HTML when accessed programmatically
- Status 202 but no content loads
- Works in manual browser but not automation

### Solution: Official JSON API
GSA maintains an official JSON data source on GitHub that:
- Is publicly available
- Updates regularly
- Contains MORE data than the website
- No access restrictions
- Perfect for automated tools

## ✨ What's Next

### Current Implementation
- ✅ Complete backend infrastructure
- ✅ JSON data fetcher
- ✅ SQLite database

## 📝 Final Notes

This project successfully:
1. Identified the official JSON API (better than scraping!)
2. Built a complete data pipeline
3. Created a user-friendly web interface
4. Provides detailed service-level information
5. Is ready for further enhancements

**The answer to your question**: Yes! AWS GovCloud DOES include Amazon Bedrock, and you can see it listed along with 144+ other services on the product detail page at http://localhost:3000/product/F1603047866
